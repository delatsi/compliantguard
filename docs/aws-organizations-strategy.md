#### Development Account (`themisguard-dev`)
- **Purpose**: Feature development, testing, CI/CD
- **Stack Names**: `themisguard-api-dev`, `themisguard-frontend-dev`
- **Cost Target**: $50-100/month
- **Data**: Synthetic/test data only

#### Staging Account (`themisguard-staging`)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing, customer demos
- **Stack Names**: `themisguard-api-staging`, `themisguard-frontend-staging`
- **Cost Target**: $100-200/month
- **Data**: Sanitized production-like data

#### Production Account (`themisguard-prod`)
- **Purpose**: Live customer workloads
- **Stack Names**: `themisguard-api-prod`, `themisguard-frontend-prod`
- **Cost Target**: Variable based on usage
- **Data**: Live customer data (HIPAA compliant)

---

## 💰 **Cost Management Strategy**

### **Billing Setup**
1. **Consolidated Billing**: Master account receives all bills
2. **Cost Allocation Tags**: Mandatory tagging for all resources
3. **Budget Alerts**: Per-account and per-project budgets
4. **Reserved Instances**: Shared across organization

### **Tagging Strategy**
```yaml
Required Tags:
  Project: themisguard | [future-project]
  Environment: dev | staging | prod
  Owner: delatsi-llc
  CostCenter: [project-code]
  
Optional Tags:
  Component: api | frontend | database | monitoring
  Team: engineering | operations
  Compliance: hipaa | sox | pci
```

### **Cost Budgets**
```yaml
Development Accounts: $100/month each
Staging Accounts: $200/month each
Production Accounts: $1000/month initial, adjust based on growth
Security Accounts: $50/month each
```

---

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices Implementation**

### **1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Mandatory MFA** for all root accounts
- **Hardware MFA** for production account access
- **Conditional MFA** for privileged operations

### **2. Identity and Access Management**
```yaml
Cross-Account Roles:
  - DeploymentRole: CI/CD access to deploy resources
  - ReadOnlyRole: Monitoring and auditing access
  - EmergencyRole: Break-glass access for incidents
  - DeveloperRole: Day-to-day development access
```

### **3. VPC and Network Security**
```yaml
Network Architecture:
  Production:
    - Private subnets for all compute
    - NAT Gateway for outbound access
    - VPC Flow Logs enabled
    - WAF for API Gateway
  
  Development:
    - Public subnets allowed for cost savings
    - Security groups with restricted access
    - CloudTrail logging enabled
```

### **4. Encryption Standards**
- **S3**: SSE-S3 minimum, SSE-KMS for sensitive data
- **DynamoDB**: Encryption at rest enabled
- **Lambda**: Environment variables encrypted
- **RDS**: Encryption at rest and in transit

---

## 📊 **Monitoring and Compliance**

### **Centralized Logging**
```yaml
Log Archive Account:
  - CloudTrail: All API calls across organization
  - Config: Resource compliance tracking
  - GuardDuty: Threat detection
  - SecurityHub: Security posture management
```

### **Compliance Monitoring**
```yaml
Config Rules:
  - required-tags
  - encrypted-volumes
  - mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access
  - root-access-key-check
  - s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
  - dynamodb-pitr-enabled
```

### **Alerting Strategy**
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Root account usage
  - Failed deployments in production
  - Security Group changes in production
  - Budget threshold exceeded (80%, 100%)
  
Warning Alerts:
  - High error rates in production
  - Unusual API usage patterns
  - Cost increases >20% month-over-month
```
