# Environment Separation for HIPAA Compliance Guide

## üìã Overview

Environment separation is a critical security control required for HIPAA compliance and SOC 2 certification. It ensures that development, staging, and production environments are properly isolated to prevent unauthorized access to Protected Health Information (PHI) and maintain system integrity.

## üéØ Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Requirements
- **¬ß164.308(a)(3)** - Administrative Safeguards: Information Access Management
- **¬ß164.308(a)(4)** - Administrative Safeguards: Information System Activity Review
- **¬ß164.312(a)(1)** - Technical Safeguards: Access Control

### SOC 2 Requirements
- **CC6.1** - Logical and Physical Access Controls
- **CC7.1** - System Operations and Processing Integrity

## üèóÔ∏è Environment Separation Strategy

### Environment Types

#### Development Environment (`dev`)
- **Purpose**: Code development and initial testing
- **Data**: Synthetic/anonymized data only - NO PHI
- **Access**: Development team members
- **Security Level**: Standard

#### Staging Environment (`staging`/`test`)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Data**: Synthetic data or sanitized production data
- **Access**: QA team, selected developers
- **Security Level**: Enhanced

#### Production Environment (`prod`)
- **Purpose**: Live system serving real users
- **Data**: Real PHI and sensitive data
- **Access**: Operations team, authorized personnel only
- **Security Level**: Maximum

## üè∑Ô∏è Required Tagging Strategy

### Mandatory Tags for All Resources

```yaml
environment: dev|staging|prod
data-classification: public|internal|confidential|restricted
phi-data: true|false
compliance-scope: hipaa|sox|pci|none
cost-center: [department-code]
owner: [team-email]
backup-required: true|false
```

### Resource Naming Conventions

```
[environment]-[service]-[component]-[region]

Examples:
- prod-web-frontend-us-east1
- staging-db-patient-data-us-west2
- dev-api-gateway-us-central1
```

## üîí Security Controls by Environment

### Network Separation

#### Production Environment
- Dedicated VPC/Virtual Network
- Private subnets for data tier
- Public subnets only for load balancers
- VPN/Private Link for administrative access
- No direct internet access to application/data tiers

#### Staging Environment  
- Separate VPC with limited connectivity to prod
- Can share some network services (DNS, monitoring)
- Controlled access to production-like configurations

#### Development Environment
- Shared development VPC
- More permissive access for development productivity
- No connectivity to production networks

### Access Controls

#### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Production:**
```yaml
Roles:
  - prod-admin: Break-glass emergency access
  - prod-operator: Day-to-day operations
  - prod-readonly: Monitoring and auditing
  - prod-backup: Backup operations only

Conditions:
  - MFA required for all access
  - Time-based access restrictions
  - IP address restrictions
  - Just-in-time access for administrative tasks
```

**Staging:**
```yaml
Roles:
  - staging-admin: Full staging environment access
  - staging-tester: Application testing access
  - staging-readonly: Read-only for verification

Conditions:
  - MFA required for admin access
  - Standard business hours access
```

**Development:**
```yaml
Roles:
  - dev-full: Full development environment access
  - dev-limited: Restricted development access

Conditions:
  - Standard authentication
  - Broader access for development efficiency
```

### Data Protection

#### Production Data Handling
- Encryption at rest (customer-managed keys)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Database column-level encryption for PHI
- Access logging and monitoring
- Data masking for non-production exports

#### Staging Data Handling
- Synthetic data generation
- Data anonymization tools
- Subset data refresh from production
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Limited data retention

#### Development Data Handling
- Synthetic data only
- Mock data services
- No production data access
- Local encryption standards

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Checklist

### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create environment-specific cloud projects/accounts
- [ ] Implement network segmentation (VPCs, subnets, security groups)
- [ ] Configure environment-specific DNS zones
- [ ] Set up cross-environment backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging per environment

### Resource Tagging
- [ ] Define and document tagging standards
- [ ] Implement automated tagging policies
- [ ] Create tag compliance monitoring
- [ ] Set up cost allocation by environment
- [ ] Regular tag compliance audits

### Access Management
- [ ] Create environment-specific IAM roles and policies
- [ ] Implement service accounts per environment
- [ ] Configure conditional access policies
- [ ] Set up privileged access management (PAM)
- [ ] Regular access reviews and cleanup

### Data Management
- [ ] Implement data classification standards
- [ ] Set up data encryption per environment
- [ ] Configure backup and retention policies
- [ ] Implement data loss prevention (DLP)
- [ ] Regular data governance reviews

### Monitoring and Compliance

- [ ] Compliance scanning and reporting
- [ ] Audit trail collection and analysis
- [ ] Incident response procedures per environment
- [ ] Regular compliance assessments

## üö® Common Violations and Remediation

### Critical: Production Data in Non-Production
**Violation**: PHI or production data found in dev/staging environments
**Remediation**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected environment
2. Purge all production data
3. Implement data classification controls
4. Retrain development team on data handling

### High: Shared Network Access
**Violation**: Production and non-production environments sharing network resources
**Remediation**:
1. Create dedicated VPCs per environment
2. Implement network segmentation
3. Review and update firewall rules
4. Monitor cross-environment traffic

### Medium: Missing Environment Tags
**Violation**: Resources lack proper environment classification
**Remediation**:
1. Audit all cloud resources
2. Apply standardized environment tags
3. Implement automated tagging policies
4. Set up tag compliance monitoring

### Medium: Excessive Cross-Environment Access
**Violation**: Users having access to multiple environments
**Remediation**:
1. Review and audit user access
2. Implement least-privilege access
3. Create environment-specific roles
4. Regular access certification process
