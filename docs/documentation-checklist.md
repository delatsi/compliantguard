## ðŸŽ¯ Documentation Quality Assessment

### **Document Quality Criteria**

For each document, assess the following quality factors:

#### Content Quality (1-5 scale)
- **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary topics?
  - 1: Major gaps, incomplete
  - 5: Comprehensive, thorough coverage

- **Accuracy**: Is the information current and correct?
  - 1: Outdated, inaccurate information
  - 5: Current, verified, accurate

- **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand and follow?
  - 1: Confusing, hard to understand
  - 5: Clear, well-written, easy to follow

- **Actionability**: Does it provide specific, actionable guidance?
  - 1: Vague, theoretical only
  - 5: Specific, actionable steps

#### Process Integration (1-5 scale)
- **Stakeholder Review**: Has it been reviewed by appropriate stakeholders?
- **Approval Process**: Is there a clear approval and sign-off process?
- **Version Control**: Is versioning properly managed?
- **Distribution**: Is it accessible to those who need it?

### **Document Health Score Calculation**

```
Document Health Score = (
    (Content Quality Average Ã— 40%) +
    (Process Integration Average Ã— 30%) +
    (Currency Factor Ã— 20%) +
    (Usage Tracking Ã— 10%)
) Ã— 20

Where:
- Content Quality Average = Average of 4 content criteria
- Process Integration Average = Average of 4 process criteria  
- Currency Factor = Days since last update (max 365, normalized)
- Usage Tracking = Frequency of access/reference
```
