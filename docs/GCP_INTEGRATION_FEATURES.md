## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Development
1. Run the GCP security setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-gcp-security.sh
   ```

2. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload

   # Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit the application and navigate to the Scan page to connect your first GCP project.

### For Production
1. Deploy the backend with GCP credential routes enabled
2. Run the production setup script for KMS and DynamoDB
3. Update environment variables with KMS key information
4. Deploy the frontend with the new GCP components

## üìã Environment Variables

Add these to your backend configuration:
```bash
KMS_KEY_ALIAS=alias/compliantguard-gcp-credentials
GCP_CREDENTIALS_TABLE=compliantguard-gcp-credentials
```

## üîç Testing the Integration

1. **Connect a GCP Project**: Use the onboarding modal to connect a test project
2. **Verify Storage**: Check DynamoDB for encrypted credential storage
3. **Test Scanning**: Run a compliance scan on the connected project
4. **Manage Projects**: Add/remove projects in Settings
5. **Check Security**: Verify KMS encryption and audit logs

## üìñ Documentation

- **Setup Guide**: `/docs/gcp-setup-guide.md` - Customer-facing setup instructions
- **Security Architecture**: Complete HIPAA-compliant credential management
- **API Documentation**: Available at `/docs` endpoint when running backend

The GCP integration is now production-ready with a complete user experience from onboarding to ongoing project management!
