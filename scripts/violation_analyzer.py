## üí° Key Insights

### Most Critical Issues
Based on the analysis, focus on these high-impact areas:

1. **GKE Security**: {analysis['violation_types'].get('GKE Private Cluster Not Enabled', 0) + analysis['violation_types'].get('Missing Network Policies', 0)} cluster security issues
2. **Pod Security**: {analysis['violation_types'].get('Pod Security Context Missing', 0)} pod security violations  
3. **Encryption**: {analysis['violation_types'].get('Encryption Not Configured', 0)} encryption configuration issues
4. **Access Control**: {analysis['violation_types'].get('Public Access Exposed', 0) + analysis['violation_types'].get('IAM Overprivileged', 0)} access control problems

### Potential Duplicates
Look for these patterns that might indicate duplicate counting:
- Multiple violations per resource (same issue reported multiple ways)
- Similar violations across different policy sources
- Resource labeling issues (administrative vs security)

### Recommended Prioritization
1. **Immediate (Critical)**: GKE private cluster, public access exposure
2. **This Week (High)**: Pod security contexts, encryption configuration  
3. **This Month (Medium)**: Network policies, service account issues
4. **Quarterly (Low)**: Resource labeling, administrative tasks

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Review Top 5 Violation Types** - These represent 80% of your issues
2. **Check for Duplicates** - Same issue might be counted multiple times
3. **Focus on GKE Security** - Kubernetes violations are often the most critical
4. **Automate Fixes** - Many violations can be fixed with scripts
